Dugaan pemerasan itu dilakukan oknum polisi berinisial FZ terhadap ibu kandung MRR, berinisial SL (58).  'Si polisi (FZ) minta Rp 10 juta untuk pisah berkas, bingunglah ibu di sana (jaksa) minta duit dan di sini (polisi) minta duit, dicarinya duit dapat cuma Rp 8 juta. Pada 4 Februari 2023, dijumpai polisi ini (FZ) dikasihnya cuma Rp 8 juta. Habis itu dibilang (FZ), uang ini mau diserahkan ke penyidiknya, biar dijadikan berkas terpisah, dia (anak SL) jadi pemakai di situ,' ungkap Tomy Faisal Pane, kuasa hukum SL, saat dikonfirmasi Kompas.com, Minggu (14/5/2023) malam. Menurut Tomy, kasus itu berawal saat MRR terjerat kasus narkoba pada 12 Januari 2023. Saat itu MRR ditangkap atas kepemilikan 1,6 gram sabu.  Lalu, SL menceritakan kasus itu ke Aiptu FZ yang bertugas di Polres Batu Bara dan merupakan tetangganya sendiri.",

The sample, which is about the size of a piece of chalk, was collected from a rock dubbed 'Rochette' in the Jezero Crater, where the rover landed in February 2021. The sample will be stored in a sealed tube and eventually returned to Earth for analysis by scientists. The Perseverance rover is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments designed to study the geology and habitability of Mars, with a particular focus on searching for signs of ancient microbial life.",
